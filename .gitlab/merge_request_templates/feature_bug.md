# Descriptive title

Your branch name is probably not descriptive enough - what specific piece of functionality does this merge request implement or solve? If there's a work item related to this merge request, put the number in the title as well.

## Overview

- Are you resolving a specific work item? If so - link to it here.
- Fleshed-out description. What did you do? On a high level, what functionality did you implement? What did you _not_ implement - and why? (if applicable)
- Are there UI/UX changes involved? If so - include an image, multiple images, or a video to showcase.

## Code

- Describe your specific technical approach to the problem.
- What files did you change, and what purpose was served by the changes in each of those files?
- If you are introducing a new pattern, explain it in detail - could it be used elsewhere in the project?

## Notes

Optional - anything else we should know? Caveats?
